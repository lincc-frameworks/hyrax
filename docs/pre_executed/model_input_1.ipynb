    "Every model needs data. It learns from data during training, \n",
    "and it makes predictions from data during inference.\n",
    "In Hyrax, that flow of information happens through two main pieces: \n",
    "a ``HyraxDataset`` and a ``DataProvider``.\n",
    "A ``HyraxDataset`` is the code that knows how to read specific data from disk.\n",
    "A ``DataProvider`` is the part we actually ask for data \u2014 it calls on one or more datasets,\n",
    "retrieves the fields we need, and hands everything back as a clean, well-structured Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we\u2019ll take our very first steps with data in Hyrax. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do:\n",
    "- Learn how to use a DataProvider to tell Hyrax what data a model should see.\n",
    "- Look inside the DataProvider to understand what the data looks like once it\u2019s ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we\u2019ll practice with a built-in Dataset called ``HyraxRandomDataset``.\n",
    "Think of it as \u201cpractice data\u201d that stands in for the real thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, our first move will be to create an instance of the Hyrax class."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A low-code solution for rapid experimentation with machine learning in astronomy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Large astronomical surveys generate unprecedented volumes of data that demand
machine learning for analysis and discovery.
The challenge for users lies in the substantial infrastructure and effort required
to acquire data and utilize machine learning at scale.

Hyrax is an extensible platform that covers the entire machine learning
workflow in astronomy.
It enables easy experimentation with models and analysis of results while saving
users from writing boilerplate code.
